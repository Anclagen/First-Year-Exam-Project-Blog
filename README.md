Design and create a blog, using WordPress as a headless CMS for the post content, as part of our end of first year exam for Noroff.

## Description

The aim of the project was to create a blog website and fill the site content using WordPress CMS. With the additional aim to create a good user experience for the blogger adding content. The website needed to be responsive and easy to navigate. This is the handed in version of the project. The page content is pulled from WordPress. The blogger can update content on all pages on the site through the WordPress interface with no need for any coding knowledge. The readers can comment on posts, and fill in a contact form which is caught by the Flamingo plugin.
